# TicTacToe

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5. 

I was also making it while going through this tutorial: https://youtu.be/G0bBLvWXBvc 

## Latest Release 

The web app that is deployed and running can be found here: https://tic-tac-toe-in-angular.web.app/ 
Check it out and give me any feedback. 

## Looking Forward

1. Have option to choose between playing the 'computer' or with a friend seated next to you.
2. Have random motivational quotes float in and out of the header instead of what is currently there!
