# TicTacToe

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5. 
I was also making it while going through this tutorial: https://youtu.be/G0bBLvWXBvc 

## Latest Release 

The web app that is deployed and running can be found here: https://tic-tac-toe-in-angular.web.app/ 
Check it out and give me any feedback. 

## Looking Forward

A friend suggested maybe the header could display different motivational quotes whenever the site is visited so I'll be working on trying to implement a way for that to work.
